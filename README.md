# [LifeExp-vs-GDP](https://fion-p.github.io/Distributions/)

Distributions is an interactive data visualization based off of Hans Rosling's TED talk on the correlation between income and lifespan. The dataset is parsed from gapminder and is used to create this visualization where users are allowed to change the countries, change the regions, and change the years. The bubbles represent each country, with the size determined by the population for that year and the color determined by the country's region.
